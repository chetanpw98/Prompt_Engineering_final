4. Open a terminal and run 
   ``` docker-compose up --build ```

5. After the container finishes building, you will be able to access the application at http://localhost:8501/

### Fine Tuning
1. **Fine-Tuning Process:** The fine-tuning process was crucial in enhancing the chatbot's performance. Below are the key steps and considerations taken:
2. **Data Collection:** Gathered diverse and representative question-answer pairs related to hospital management. The dataset was stored in a JSON file (fine_tuning_data.json) containing prompts and corresponding responses.
3. **Training Data Preparation:** Converted the raw data into a format suitable for fine-tuning, with prompt and completion keys.
4. **Prompt Engineering:** Developed a specific prompt template emphasizing the chatbot's role as a hospital management assistant.The template ensured that responses were contextually relevant and accurate.
5. **Model Selection:** Utilized the text-davinci-003 model from OpenAI for fine-tuning, chosen for its balance of performance and efficiency.
6. **Iterative Fine-Tuning:** Ran multiple iterations of fine-tuning with the prepared dataset.
Each iteration was reviewed to ensure improvements in response accuracy and relevance.
7. **Memory Integration:** Incorporated ConversationBufferMemory to maintain context across interactions, enhancing the conversational experience.
8. **Testing and Validation:** Post fine-tuning, the model was rigorously tested with new queries to validate its performance.Adjustments were made based on testing feedback to optimize the final model.
9. **Deployment:** The fine-tuned model was integrated into the chatbot's architecture, improving its response quality and user experience.


### Key Features and Functionalities

-   **Intelligent Query Resolution:** The chatbot can efficiently answer complex queries related to hospital management, including information on physicians, patient records, hospital reviews, and visit history, leveraging Neo4j's graph database.
-   **Custom Cypher Queries:** Users can ask detailed questions requiring specific Cypher queries, with the chatbot dynamically generating these queries based on the context.
-   **Context-Aware Conversations:** The chatbot maintains context across interactions, ensuring coherent and relevant responses throughout a conversation.
-   **Data-Driven Insights:** The system provides data-driven recommendations and insights, helping hospital administrators make informed decisions.

### Challenges Faced and How They Were Overcome

-   **Neo4j Integration:** Integrating Neo4j with the LLM presented challenges, particularly in ensuring accurate Cypher query generation. This was addressed by iterative prompt engineering and model fine-tuning, improving the chatbot's ability to generate precise queries.
-   **Maintaining Context:** Ensuring the chatbot retained context over extended interactions was challenging. This was mitigated by incorporating ConversationBufferMemory, which helped maintain continuity in dialogues.
-   **Fine-Tuning for Specificity:** Tailoring the LLM to the hospital domain required fine-tuning with domain-specific data. The challenge of obtaining relevant data was overcome by creating custom datasets, which significantly enhanced the model's relevance and accuracy.

### Conclusion

The CareCompanion AI chatbot effectively combines large language models with specialized knowledge bases to provide context-aware solutions in healthcare. By integrating advanced prompt engineering techniques and Neo4j, it addresses complex hospital management queries, proving to be a valuable tool for healthcare professionals.

### Future Scope

-   **Knowledge Base Expansion:** Incorporate additional datasets covering more aspects of healthcare management.
-   **Multilingual Support:** Add multilingual capabilities to serve a broader audience.
-   **Enhanced AI Models:** Upgrade to advanced models with reinforcement learning for improved accuracy.
-   **Mobile Integration:** Develop a mobile version for greater accessibility.
